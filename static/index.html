Ongaigui. It aims to make tertiary education more accessible through online learning. By delivering online courses with the same code and title and with similar content as the actual courses in a program, students can contextualize their learning. Lecturers will also have an easier time teaching concepts and foundations due to this contextualization. Going deeper, the university can begin to truly construct and support interdisciplinary projects and programs, and the line among programs blur without the need for the actual boundaries to disappear or to be put down.</font></p>

<p><font size="5" color="#000000" style="line-height:120%">Going further, <span style="color: #B82669; font-family: Open Sans">ara</span><span style="color: #8B8D90; font-family: Open Sans">l</span><span style="color: #1F9FD9; font-family: Open Sans">X</span> revolutionizes education by allowing students to return, if not begin their journey, to the university. Students who were once discouraged or prevented from going to a university can regain their confidence and find their passion. As the online courses match the actual courses offered, then having taken online courses from the platform, students can more easily adapt and adjust to the requirements and expectations.</font></p>

It provides an avenue for students to celebrate the university and what it stands for, to partake in its programs for betterment, including the research it conducts and the programs it implements for society. By establishing this reality, Janssen hopes to shine a brighter light towards the future.</font></p>
